The folder `Training and Linearization Calculation` contains code dealing with constructing and training networks and retrieving their sampled linear regions for the MNIST experimetnal results.

`plotMNISTregions.ipynb` displays the linear regions corresponding to a specific input image

`Number of regions.ipynb` counts how many linear regions are used across all training samples for MNIST

`ClusterReduction.ipynb` contains the code for calculating k-means clustering

`Compare Linear Regions.ipynb` contains the code for affine mapping between networks linear regions

`XOR linear Regions.ipynb` contains code dealing with the XOR examples

The `animations` deals with code for creating the visuals and animations for the circle versus annulus problems

Animations are available at:
